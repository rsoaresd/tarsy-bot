# Comprehensive Internet Research

Perform thorough internet research to gather the most current and comprehensive information:

1. **Choose Relevant Sources** (use what makes sense for the task):
   - Official documentation and API references
   - Best practices and design patterns
   - Recent blog posts and articles (check dates)
   - Stack Overflow and community discussions
   - GitHub issues and pull requests
   - Relevant academic papers or technical reports

2. **Cross-Reference When Needed**:
   - Verify important information across sources
   - Look for consensus on best practices
   - Identify conflicting opinions and evaluate them
   - Check for version-specific information when relevant

3. **Stay Current** (when version/recency matters):
   - Prioritize sources published within the last 1–3 years (adjust timeframe by domain; use longer windows for historical or foundational topics)
   - Look for deprecation notices or updates
   - Check for new features or alternatives
   - Identify emerging patterns and trends

4. **Synthesize Results**:
   - Summarize key findings with source citations
   - Compare different approaches and trade-offs
   - Provide recommendations based on research
   - Highlight any gaps or uncertainties

Present findings clearly with links to sources for further reading.
