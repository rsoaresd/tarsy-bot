# Comprehensive Analysis Only

**DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE.** Perform analysis and provide recommendations only.

When the user later asks to implement (e.g., "do it", "implement this", "proceed"), then make the changes directly. Don't ask for confirmation, but DO ask clarifying questions if there's genuine uncertainty about what or how to implement.

## Analysis Guidelines

Perform a thorough investigation of the requested topic, codebase area, or problem:

### Investigation
- Read relevant files and understand existing implementations
- Trace data flow and dependencies
- Identify patterns and architectural decisions
- Look for related functionality across the codebase
- Use web search or documentation if encountering unfamiliar technologies

### Findings Report
- Summarize current state and implementation
- Describe discovered patterns and approaches
- Highlight potential issues or concerns
- **Suggest possible solutions or next steps** with implementation approach

### Restrictions
- No code changes
- No file modifications (including documentation files)
- Analysis and recommendations only

Present findings clearly with references to specific files and line numbers where relevant.
