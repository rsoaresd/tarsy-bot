# EP-0025: PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY Eventing System

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation Date:** October 2025

**Key Change:** Original design specified Server-Sent Events (SSE) for dashboard communication. During implementation, SSE reliability issues were discovered in multi-tab scenarios. WebSocket was implemented instead, providing:
- Bidirectional communication (client can send subscription messages)
- Better connection management across multiple browser tabs
- Single connection per tab with channel-based subscriptions
- Robust reconnection and catchup mechanism

The core architecture (PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY, event persistence, cross-pod distribution) remains as designed. Only the dashboard transport layer differs from the original specification.

---

## Problem Statement

TARSy needs a cross-pod event distribution mechanism to support multi-replica Kubernetes deployments. Events must be reliably delivered to all backend pods for:
- Dashboard real-time updates (WebSocket)
- Session state synchronization
- Active session tracking
- System notifications

This EP provides the detailed design for implementing event distribution using PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY with SQLite polling fallback for development. Events are delivered to dashboard clients via WebSocket connections.

**Note:** SQLite polling is for development only. Production multi-replica deployments require PostgreSQL.

## Related Enhancements

- **EP-0024**: Multi-Replica Kubernetes Support - This eventing system solves 3 of 7 issues identified in EP-0024:
  - Issue #2: WebSocket Connection Management
  - Issue #5: Dashboard Message Buffering

#### Timeline: Replica Failover with Zero Event Loss

| Time | Event | Client State | Database State |
|------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **10:00:00** | Client connects to Replica 1<br/>`WebSocket /api/v1/ws` | ✅ Connected<br/>WS → Replica 1<br/>Subscribed to "sessions" | Empty events table |
| **10:00:15** | Event 41 published<br/>(session.started) | ✅ Receives event 41<br/>`last_event_id=41` | `id=41` persisted<br/>NOTIFY → All pods |
| **10:00:30** | Event 42 published<br/>(llm.interaction) | ✅ Receives event 42<br/>`last_event_id=42` | `id=42` persisted<br/>NOTIFY → All pods |
| **10:00:45** | 💥 **Replica 1 crashes**<br/>(pod killed by k8s) | ⚠️ **Connection lost**<br/>Disconnected | Database intact<br/>Events 41-42 safe |
| **10:00:46** | Event 43 published<br/>(by Replica 2) | ❌ Not received<br/>Still disconnected | `id=43` persisted<br/>NOTIFY (no listeners) |
| **10:00:47** | Event 44 published<br/>(by Replica 3) | ❌ Not received<br/>Still disconnected | `id=44` persisted<br/>NOTIFY (no listeners) |
| **10:00:48** | **Browser auto-reconnects**<br/>`WebSocket /api/v1/ws` | 🔄 Reconnecting...<br/>Routes to Replica 2 | Query: `WHERE id>42` |
| **10:00:49** | **CATCHUP:** Sends events 43-44<br/>(from database) | ✅ Receives event 43<br/>✅ Receives event 44<br/>`last_event_id=44` | Returns: `[43, 44]`<br/>from database |
| **10:00:50** | WebSocket connection ready<br/>with Replica 2 | ✅ Connected<br/>WS → Replica 2<br/>Subscribed to "sessions" | Ready for live events |
| **10:01:00** | Event 45 published<br/>(stage.completed) | ✅ Receives event 45<br/>`last_event_id=45` | `id=45` persisted<br/>NOTIFY → All pods |
| **10:01:15** | Event 46 published<br/>(session.completed) | ✅ Receives event 46<br/>`last_event_id=46` | `id=46` persisted<br/>NOTIFY → All pods |
| **Result** | **Zero events lost**<br/>Seamless failover | ✅ All events received<br/>UI stays synchronized | All events stored<br/>Database consistent |

#### Key Observations

**Event Loss Prevention:**
- ✅ Events 43-44 published while client disconnected
- ✅ Events persisted to database immediately
- ✅ Catchup query retrieves missed events on reconnection
- ✅ Client receives ALL events in correct order: 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46

**Replica Independence:**
- ✅ Event 43 published by Replica 2 → Replica 3 receives via NOTIFY
- ✅ Event 44 published by Replica 3 → Replica 2 receives via NOTIFY
- ✅ Any replica can publish, all replicas broadcast to their clients

**Automatic Failover:**
- ✅ Browser detects disconnection (~1-2 seconds)
- ✅ Auto-reconnects with last known event ID
- ✅ Kubernetes routes to healthy replica
- ✅ No manual intervention required

**Database as Source of Truth:**
- ✅ All events persisted BEFORE broadcast
- ✅ Catchup always possible (events table = event log)
- ✅ Works even if ALL replicas crash (events safe in DB)

### Event Flow

```text
1. Alert Processing:
   - Pod 2 processes alert
   - Writes event to events table (persistence)
   - Executes NOTIFY command (broadcast)

2. Event Distribution:
   - PostgreSQL broadcasts to ALL pods with LISTEN
   - Each pod receives notification payload
   - Pod 1, Pod 2, Pod 3 all get the event

3. Local Dispatch:
   - Each pod checks registered callbacks
   - Forwards event to SSE clients
   - Dashboard receives update in real-time

4. Catchup on Reconnection:
   - Dashboard client reconnects (sends last_event_id)
   - Server queries events table for missed events
   - Replays missed events to client via SSE
   - Client resumes real-time subscription
```

### Database Schema

The events table is defined using SQLModel following tarsy's ORM-first approach:

```python
# backend/tarsy/models/db_models.py

from datetime import datetime

from sqlmodel import Column, Field, SQLModel, Index
from sqlalchemy import JSON, BigInteger, DateTime, func


class Event(SQLModel, table=True):
    """
    Event persistence for cross-pod event distribution and catchup.
    
    Stores events for PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY system with SQLite polling fallback.
    Enables reliable event delivery across multiple backend pods and client reconnection
    with catchup support.
    """
    
    __tablename__ = "events"
    
    __table_args__ = (
        # Index for cleanup performance (time-based queries)
        Index('idx_events_created_at', 'created_at'),
        
        # Composite index for polling queries (SQLite dev mode)
        Index('idx_events_channel_id', 'channel', 'id'),
    )
    
    id: int = Field(
        default=None,
        sa_column=Column(BigInteger, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True),
        description="Auto-incrementing event ID for ordering and catchup"
    )
    
    channel: str = Field(
        max_length=100,
        index=True,
        description="Event channel (e.g., 'sessions', 'session:abc-123')"
    )
    
    payload: dict = Field(
        sa_column=Column(JSON),
        description="Event data as JSON (type, data, timestamp, id)"
    )
    
    created_at: datetime = Field(
        default=None,
        sa_column=Column(
            DateTime,
            nullable=False,
            server_default=func.now()
        ),
        description="Event creation timestamp (for cleanup and ordering)"
    )
```

**Design Notes:**
- Uses standard `TIMESTAMP`/`DateTime` (not tarsy's microsecond pattern) for simpler time-series cleanup
- Uses `JSON` column type (database-agnostic, adequate for event payloads at our scale)
- Auto-incrementing `id` provides ordering for catchup queries
- Indexes optimized for both cleanup (by time) and polling (by channel + id)

**Alignment with tarsy Patterns:**
- ✅ SQLModel ORM-first approach (defined as Python class, not raw SQL)
- ✅ Comprehensive type hints with Field descriptions
- ✅ Google-style docstrings
- ✅ Alembic migrations for schema management
- ✅ Database-agnostic design (PostgreSQL + SQLite)
- ✅ Model placed in `tarsy/models/db_models.py` with other tables
- ✅ Auto-discovered by Alembic via existing import patterns

### Event Channels

TARSy uses a **2-channel architecture** based on scope and granularity:

```python
# Channel naming convention
CHANNEL_SESSIONS = "sessions"                          # Global session lifecycle
CHANNEL_SESSION_DETAILS = "session:{session_id}"       # Per-session operations
```

**Channel 1: `sessions` (Global Session Lifecycle)**

Tracks lifecycle events for ALL sessions. Used by:
- Dashboard main page (session list)
- System monitoring tools
- CLI showing all active sessions

**Events:**
- `session.created` - New session initiated
- `session.started` - Processing began
- `session.completed` - Session finished successfully
- `session.failed` - Session encountered error

**Channel 2: `session:{session_id}` (Per-Session Details)**

Tracks detailed operations within a SPECIFIC session. Used by:
- Session detail page/timeline view
- CLI following specific session progress

**Events:**
- `llm.interaction` - LLM call during processing
- `mcp.tool_call` - MCP tool executed
- `mcp.tool_list` - MCP tools listed (available tools query)
- `stage.started` - Chain stage began
- `stage.completed` - Chain stage finished

**Design Rationale:**
- Clear separation: lifecycle (lightweight) vs operations (detailed)
- Bandwidth efficient: No duplicate broadcasting to multiple channels
- Consumers subscribe only to what they need
- Active session count derived by consumers from `sessions` events (no separate channel needed)

### Event Models (Pydantic)

TARSy uses **Pydantic models for type-safe event publishing**. Events are **notification triggers** that prompt dashboard clients to refresh via REST API, keeping payloads minimal.

**Design Philosophy:**
- ✅ **Type-safe at publish** - Pydantic validates event structure
- ✅ **Minimal payloads** - Events are notifications, not data transfers
- ✅ **Context IDs included** - `interaction_id`, `stage_id` for potential client-side optimization
- ✅ **Instant feedback fields** - `status` included for immediate UI updates
- ❌ **No large objects** - No `conversation`, `details`, or full data structures

```python
# backend/tarsy/models/event_models.py

"""
Event models for type-safe event publishing.

Events are lightweight notification triggers that inform clients about changes.
Clients use these events to determine when to refresh data via REST API.

**Repository Design Notes:**
- ✅ Minimal interface: Only 3 methods, all actively used
- ✅ Follows tarsy's repository pattern (composition, not inheritance)
- ✅ Async operations using `AsyncSession`
- ✅ Type-safe: Returns `Event` objects, not raw tuples
- ✅ ORM-based queries (except NOTIFY which stays in publisher)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Methods:**
1. `create_event()` → Used by EventPublisher
2. `get_events_after()` → Used by SSE catchup & SQLite polling
3. `delete_events_before()` → Used by EventCleanupService

**Publisher Design Notes:**
- ✅ **Type-safe with Pydantic** - Validation at publish time prevents bugs
- ✅ **Minimal payloads** - Pydantic models enforce lean event structure
- ✅ Uses EventRepository for all database operations (no raw SQL for CRUD)
- ✅ Detects database type upfront (follows tarsy pattern)
- ✅ NOTIFY only executed on PostgreSQL - no silent error catching
- ✅ NOTIFY failures on PostgreSQL propagate (real errors, not ignored)
- ✅ Testable: Mock the repository interface easily
- ✅ Convenience function `publish_event()` for quick one-off publishes

**Manager Design Notes:**
- ✅ Follows tarsy's service pattern (like `AlertService`, `DashboardConnectionManager`)
- ✅ Encapsulates all event system concerns (listener, cleanup, channels)
- ✅ Clean separation: keeps `main.py` minimal
- ✅ Testable: Easy to mock in tests
- ✅ Global accessor: `get_event_system()` available anywhere
- ✅ Lifecycle management: Single start/stop interface
- ✅ Channel registration: Centralized handler management

**SSE Endpoint Design Notes:**
- ✅ Follows tarsy's controller pattern (`controllers/events_controller.py`)
- ✅ Uses EventRepository for catchup queries (no raw SQL)
- ✅ Type-safe: Works with `Event` objects
- ✅ Channel is required parameter (explicit over implicit)
- ✅ Clients should use `EventChannel.SESSIONS` or `EventChannel.session_details(session_id)`
- ✅ Proper logging with `get_logger()` (tarsy pattern)
- ✅ Graceful client disconnection handling
- ✅ Proper cleanup: Unsubscribes callback on disconnect (prevents memory leaks)

**URL:**
- `GET /api/v1/events/stream?channel=sessions`
- `GET /api/v1/events/stream?channel=session:abc-123&last_event_id=42`


### Integration with TARSy

#### 1. Register Events Router

```python
# backend/tarsy/main.py

# Add to existing router imports
from tarsy.controllers.history_controller import router as history_router
from tarsy.controllers.alert_controller import router as alert_router
from tarsy.controllers.system_controller import router as system_router
from tarsy.controllers.events_controller import router as events_router  # NEW

# Register routers
app.include_router(history_router, tags=["history"])
app.include_router(alert_router, tags=["alerts"])
app.include_router(system_router, tags=["system"])
app.include_router(events_router, tags=["events"])  # NEW
```

#### 2. Initialize Event System

```python
# backend/tarsy/main.py

from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI

from tarsy.config.settings import get_settings
from tarsy.services.events.manager import EventSystemManager, set_event_system

    # SSE clients subscribe directly via /api/v1/events/stream
    # Events flow: Publish → EventListener → SSE clients
    
    logger.info("TARSy startup complete")
    
    yield  # Application runs
    
    # Shutdown (clean and simple!)
    await event_system.stop()

            event
        )
```

**Publishing Stage Events:**

```python
# backend/tarsy/services/chain_executor.py (or stage management)

from tarsy.models.event_models import StageStartedEvent, StageCompletedEvent


async def on_stage_started(
    session_id: str,
    stage_id: str,
    stage_name: str
):
    """Called when chain stage starts."""
    async with get_async_session() as db_session:
        event = StageStartedEvent(
            session_id=session_id,
            stage_id=stage_id,
            stage_name=stage_name
        )
        
        await publish_event(
            db_session,
            EventChannel.session_details(session_id),
            event
        )


async def on_stage_completed(
    session_id: str,
    stage_id: str,
    stage_name: str,
    status: str
):
    """Called when chain stage completes."""
    async with get_async_session() as db_session:
        event = StageCompletedEvent(
            session_id=session_id,
            stage_id=stage_id,
            stage_name=stage_name,
            status=status
        )
        
        await publish_event(
            db_session,
            EventChannel.session_details(session_id),
            event
        )
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ **Type-safe** - Pydantic validates at publish time
- ✅ **Minimal payloads** - Only notification data, no full objects
- ✅ **Clean integration** - Simple function calls, no complex setup
- ✅ **Context IDs included** - `interaction_id`, `stage_id` for client optimization
- ✅ **No event handlers needed** - Events flow directly to SSE clients

### Configuration

```python
# backend/tarsy/config/settings.py

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # ... existing settings ...
    
    # Event System Configuration
    event_retention_hours: int = Field(
        default=24,
        description="How long to retain events in events table (hours)"
    )
    
    event_cleanup_interval_hours: int = Field(
        default=6,
        description="How often to run event cleanup (hours)"
    )
```

### Database Migration

After adding the `Event` SQLModel to `backend/tarsy/models/db_models.py`, generate and apply the migration:

```bash
# Generate migration (auto-detects Event model)
make db-migration-generate MESSAGE="add events table for cross-pod eventing"

# Apply migration
make db-migrate-up
```

**Expected Migration:**
- Creates `events` table with columns: `id`, `channel`, `payload`, `created_at`
- Creates indexes: `idx_events_created_at`, `idx_events_channel_id`, `ix_events_channel`
- Alembic will auto-generate the migration code from the `Event` SQLModel

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check migration was applied
make db-current

# Verify table exists
# PostgreSQL: \dt events
# SQLite: .tables events
```

## Implementation Plan

This plan is designed to be followed by AI assistants for actual implementation. Each phase includes specific file paths, integration points, and verification steps.

---

### Phase 1: Foundation (Database & Models)

**Goal:** Set up database schema and event models

#### 1.1 Create Event Models
**File:** `backend/tarsy/models/event_models.py` (NEW)
- Copy the complete Pydantic event models from the "Event Models (Pydantic)" section of this EP
- All 8 event types: `SessionCreatedEvent`, `SessionStartedEvent`, `SessionCompletedEvent`, `SessionFailedEvent`, `LLMInteractionEvent`, `MCPToolCallEvent`, `MCPToolListEvent`, `StageStartedEvent`, `StageCompletedEvent`

**Verification:** Run `python -m backend.tarsy.models.event_models` - should import without errors

#### 1.2 Add Event SQLModel
**File:** `backend/tarsy/models/db_models.py`
- Add the `Event` SQLModel class from the "Database Schema" section of this EP
- Place it after existing models (e.g., after `StageExecution`)

**Verification:** Check that model is discovered: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "test"` (don't commit)

#### 1.3 Create Alembic Migration
**Command:** `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add events table for cross-pod eventing"`
- **File generated:** `backend/alembic/versions/YYYYMMDD_HHMM_<hash>_add_events_table.py`
- Verify migration matches the `Event` SQLModel schema
- Ensure indexes are created: `idx_events_created_at`, `idx_events_channel_id`, `ix_events_channel`

**Verification:** 
- `alembic upgrade head` - should create events table
- `alembic downgrade -1` - should drop events table
- `alembic upgrade head` - restore for next phases

#### 1.4 Add Event Channels Constants
**File:** `backend/tarsy/services/events/channels.py` (NEW)

#### 2.5 Create Factory Function
**File:** `backend/tarsy/services/events/factory.py` (NEW)
- Copy `create_event_listener()` function from the "Event Listener Factory" section of this EP
- Auto-selects listener based on database URL

**Verification:** Test both paths:
```python
pg_listener = create_event_listener("postgresql://...")  # Returns PostgreSQLEventListener
sqlite_listener = create_event_listener("sqlite:///...")  # Returns SQLiteEventListener
```

#### 2.6 Implement Event Publisher
**File:** `backend/tarsy/services/events/publisher.py` (NEW)
- Copy `EventPublisher` class and `publish_event()` function from the "Event Publisher" section of this EP
- Uses EventRepository for persistence
- Uses `text()` for NOTIFY command (PostgreSQL only)

**Verification:** Publish test event:
```python
from tarsy.models.event_models import SessionStartedEvent
event = SessionStartedEvent(session_id="test", alert_type="test")
event_id = await publish_event(session, EventChannel.SESSIONS, event)
assert event_id > 0
```

---

### Phase 3: Event System Management

**Goal:** Centralize event system lifecycle

#### 3.1 Implement EventSystemManager
**File:** `backend/tarsy/services/events/manager.py` (NEW)
- Copy complete `EventSystemManager` class from the "Event System Manager" section of this EP
- Manages listener and cleanup service lifecycle
- Provides global accessors: `get_event_system()`, `set_event_system()`

    default=24,
    description="How long to retain events in events table (hours)"
)

event_cleanup_interval_hours: int = Field(
    default=6,
    description="How often to run event cleanup (hours)"
)
```

**Verification:** `from tarsy.config.settings import get_settings; print(get_settings().event_retention_hours)`

---

### Phase 4: WebSocket Endpoint & Main Integration

**Goal:** Create WebSocket endpoint and integrate into main app

**Implementation Note:** Originally designed for SSE, but WebSocket was implemented for better reliability in multi-tab scenarios.

#### 4.1 Create WebSocket Controller
**File:** `backend/tarsy/controllers/websocket_controller.py` (NEW)
- Implements: `WebSocket /api/v1/ws`
- Handles client messages: subscribe, unsubscribe, catchup, ping
- Manages connection lifecycle and subscriptions
- Includes catchup mechanism via `EventRepository.get_events_after()`

**Key Components:**
- `WebSocketConnectionManager` - Tracks connections and channel subscriptions
- `websocket_endpoint()` - Main WebSocket handler
- Integrates with `EventListener` to register callbacks for database events

**Verification:** 
- Start server
- Connect via WebSocket client to `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws`
- Send: `{"action":"subscribe","channel":"sessions"}`
- Should receive: `{"type":"subscription.confirmed","channel":"sessions"}`

#### 4.2 Update main.py
**File:** `backend/tarsy/main.py`

**Changes:**
1. **Import EventSystemManager:**
   ```python
   from tarsy.services.events.manager import EventSystemManager, set_event_system
   ```

2. **Update lifespan function** (replace existing event setup):
   - Initialize `EventSystemManager` in startup
   - Call `event_system.start()` and `set_event_system()`
   - Call `event_system.stop()` in shutdown

3. **Register WebSocket router:**
   ```python
   from tarsy.controllers.websocket_controller import websocket_router
   app.include_router(websocket_router)
   ```

**Verification:**
- Start server
- Check logs for: `"Event system started successfully"`
- Check API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs` - should show `/api/v1/ws` endpoint

#### 4.3 Enhance Existing Health Check
**File:** `backend/tarsy/main.py`

**Location:** `@app.get("/health")` endpoint (~line 167)

**Add event system status to existing health check response:**
```python
# Inside existing health_check() function
# Add this to the returned dict:

event_system = get_event_system()
event_listener = event_system.get_listener() if event_system else None

health_response["event_system"] = {
    "status": "healthy" if event_listener and event_listener.running else "degraded",
    "type": event_listener.__class__.__name__ if event_listener else "unknown"
}
```

**Note:** 
- Enhance the **existing** `/health` endpoint
- Do **NOT** create a new health check endpoint
- Add event system status alongside existing health checks

**Verification:**
- `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Response should include:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy",
    "event_system": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "type": "PostgreSQLEventListener"  // or "SQLiteEventListener"
    }
  }
  ```

---

### Phase 5: Integrate Event Publishing

**Goal:** Publish events from existing services, remove WebSocket dependencies

#### 5.1 Integrate Session Lifecycle Events

**File:** `backend/tarsy/services/history_service.py`

**Location 1: Session Created** (~line 279)
```python
# After: created_session = repo.create_alert_session(session)
if created_session:
    logger.info(f"Created history session {created_session.session_id} for alert {alert_id}")
    
    # Publish session.created event
    from tarsy.models.event_models import SessionCreatedEvent
    from tarsy.services.events.publisher import publish_event
    from tarsy.services.events.channels import EventChannel
    
    event = SessionCreatedEvent(
        session_id=created_session.session_id,
        alert_type=chain_context.processing_alert.alert_type
    )
    await publish_event(session, EventChannel.SESSIONS, event)
    
    return True
```

**Location 2: Session Status Updates** (~line 288)
```python
# In update_session_status() method
# After database update, add:

# Publish status event
from tarsy.models.event_models import SessionCompletedEvent, SessionFailedEvent
from tarsy.services.events.publisher import publish_event
from tarsy.services.events.channels import EventChannel

if status == AlertSessionStatus.COMPLETED.value:
    event = SessionCompletedEvent(session_id=session_id, status="completed")
    await publish_event(session, EventChannel.SESSIONS, event)
elif status == AlertSessionStatus.FAILED.value:
    event = SessionFailedEvent(session_id=session_id, status="failed")
    await publish_event(session, EventChannel.SESSIONS, event)
```

**File:** `backend/tarsy/services/alert_service.py`

**Location: Session Started** (~line 277)
```python
# After: self._update_session_status(chain_context.session_id, AlertSessionStatus.IN_PROGRESS.value)
# Add:

# Publish session.started event
from tarsy.models.event_models import SessionStartedEvent
from tarsy.services.events.publisher import publish_event
from tarsy.services.events.channels import EventChannel

event = SessionStartedEvent(
    session_id=chain_context.session_id,
    alert_type=chain_context.processing_alert.alert_type
)
await publish_event(session, EventChannel.SESSIONS, event)
```

**Verification:**
- Submit an alert via API
- Monitor SSE stream: `curl -N http://localhost:8000/api/v1/events/stream?channel=sessions`
- Should receive: `session.created` → `session.started` → `session.completed/failed`

#### 5.2 Integrate Interaction Events

**File:** `backend/tarsy/hooks/event_hooks.py`

**Replace WebSocket with Events in Each Hook:**

**In `LLMEventHook.execute()` (~line 30):**
```python
# REMOVE: await self.dashboard_broadcaster.broadcast_interaction_update(...)

# ADD: Publish llm.interaction event
from tarsy.models.event_models import LLMInteractionEvent
from tarsy.services.events.publisher import publish_event
from tarsy.services.events.channels import EventChannel

event = LLMInteractionEvent(
    session_id=truncated_interaction.session_id,
    interaction_id=truncated_interaction.interaction_id,
    stage_id=truncated_interaction.stage_execution_id
)
# Need database session here - get from hook context or pass as parameter
await publish_event(db_session, EventChannel.session_details(event.session_id), event)
```

**In `MCPEventHook.execute()` (~line 80):**
```python
# REMOVE: await self.dashboard_broadcaster.broadcast_interaction_update(...)

# ADD: Publish mcp.tool_call event
from tarsy.models.event_models import MCPToolCallEvent
event = MCPToolCallEvent(
    session_id=interaction.session_id,
    interaction_id=interaction.request_id,
    tool_name=interaction.tool_name,
    stage_id=interaction.stage_execution_id
)
await publish_event(db_session, EventChannel.session_details(event.session_id), event)
```

**In `MCPListEventHook.execute()` (~line 131):**
```python
# REMOVE: await self.dashboard_broadcaster.broadcast_interaction_update(...)

# ADD: Publish mcp.tool_list event
from tarsy.models.event_models import MCPToolListEvent
event = MCPToolListEvent(
    session_id=interaction.session_id,
    request_id=interaction.request_id,
    server_name=interaction.server_name,
    stage_id=interaction.stage_execution_id
)
await publish_event(db_session, EventChannel.session_details(event.session_id), event)
```

**In `StageExecutionEventHook.execute()` (~line 184):**
```python
# REMOVE: await self.dashboard_broadcaster.broadcast_session_update(...)

# ADD: Publish stage events
from tarsy.models.event_models import StageStartedEvent, StageCompletedEvent

if stage_execution.status == StageStatus.STARTED:
    event = StageStartedEvent(
        session_id=stage_execution.session_id,
        stage_id=stage_execution.execution_id,
        stage_name=stage_execution.stage_name
    )
elif stage_execution.status in [StageStatus.COMPLETED, StageStatus.FAILED]:
    event = StageCompletedEvent(
        session_id=stage_execution.session_id,
        stage_id=stage_execution.execution_id,
        stage_name=stage_execution.stage_name,
        status=stage_execution.status
    )
    
await publish_event(db_session, EventChannel.session_details(event.session_id), event)
```

**Note:** Hooks need access to database session. Options:
1. Pass `db_session` to hook constructors
2. Create session inside hook (use `get_async_session()`)
3. Refactor hooks to accept session as parameter

**Verification:**
- Submit alert, open session detail page
- Monitor: `curl -N http://localhost:8000/api/v1/events/stream?channel=session:SESSION_ID`
- Should receive: `llm.interaction`, `mcp.tool_call`, `mcp.tool_list`, `stage.started`, `stage.completed`

#### 5.3 Remove WebSocket Infrastructure

**Critical:** Only remove after SSE is fully working and tested!

**Files to Remove:**
- `backend/tarsy/services/dashboard_connection_manager.py`
- `backend/tarsy/services/dashboard_broadcaster.py`
- `backend/tarsy/services/dashboard_update_service.py`
- `backend/tarsy/models/websocket_models.py`

**File:** `backend/tarsy/main.py`
- Remove WebSocket endpoint: `@app.websocket("/ws/dashboard/{user_id}")`
- Remove WebSocket imports and initialization from `lifespan`
- Remove: `dashboard_manager` global variable

**File:** `backend/tarsy/hooks/event_hooks.py`
- Remove `dashboard_broadcaster` from hook constructors
- Hooks should only publish events (already done in step 5.2)

**Verification:**
- Server starts without WebSocket references
- Dashboard receives events via SSE
- No WebSocket errors in logs

---

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation

**Goal:** Ensure system works in all modes

#### 6.1 Unit Tests

**File:** `backend/tests/unit/services/test_event_repository.py` (NEW)
```python
# Test EventRepository CRUD operations
async def test_create_event()
async def test_get_events_after()
async def test_delete_events_before()
```

**File:** `backend/tests/unit/services/test_event_publisher.py` (NEW)
```python
# Test event publishing with mock repository
async def test_publish_event_postgresql()
async def test_publish_event_sqlite()
async def test_pydantic_validation()
```

**File:** `backend/tests/unit/services/test_event_listeners.py` (NEW)
```python
# Test listeners (may require mocking asyncpg/database)
async def test_postgresql_listener_subscribe()
async def test_sqlite_listener_polling()
```

#### 6.2 Integration Tests

**File:** `backend/tests/integration/test_event_system.py` (NEW)
```python
# Test full flow: publish → listen → receive
async def test_event_flow_postgresql()
async def test_event_flow_sqlite()
async def test_event_catchup()
async def test_multi_channel_subscription()
```

#### 6.3 Manual Testing Checklist

**SQLite Mode (Dev):**
- [ ] Submit alert → see events in `curl` SSE stream
- [ ] Open session detail → see interaction events
- [ ] Disconnect/reconnect SSE → catchup works
- [ ] Check events table has data: `sqlite3 tarsy.db "SELECT * FROM events LIMIT 10;"`

**PostgreSQL Mode (Prod):**
- [ ] Submit alert → events appear immediately (no 0.5s polling delay)
- [ ] Open session detail → see interaction events
- [ ] Run 2 backend replicas → both receive NOTIFY
- [ ] Disconnect/reconnect SSE → catchup works
- [ ] Check NOTIFY is used: monitor PostgreSQL logs

**Multi-Replica (Kubernetes):**
- [ ] Deploy 3 replicas
- [ ] Submit alert via replica 1
- [ ] Connect SSE to replica 2
- [ ] Verify replica 2 receives events from replica 1's NOTIFY
- [ ] Kill replica 2 → client reconnects to replica 3 → catchup works

---

### Phase 7: Dashboard Migration

**Goal:** Update React dashboard to use WebSocket for real-time updates

**Note:** This is a separate effort, but here's the high-level plan:

**Implementation Note:** WebSocket was chosen over SSE for better multi-tab reliability and bidirectional communication.

#### 7.1 Create WebSocket Service
**File:** `dashboard/src/services/websocketService.ts` (NEW)
- Replace `websocket.ts` with SSE EventSource
- Use `EventSource` API for SSE connections
- Implement reconnection with `last_event_id`

#### 7.2 Update Components
- Replace `webSocketService.connect()` with `sseService.connect()`
- Update channel subscriptions to use SSE channels
- Handle reconnection gracefully

#### 7.3 Remove WebSocket Code
- Delete `dashboard/src/services/websocket.ts`
- Remove WebSocket imports from components

---

## Post-Implementation Checklist

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - WebSocket implementation deployed and tested

**Completed:**
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ All integration tests pass  
- ✅ Manual testing complete (SQLite + PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Dashboard updated with WebSocket service
- ✅ WebSocket endpoint with channel subscriptions implemented
- ✅ PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY working in production
- ✅ Event persistence and catchup mechanism validated

**Pending:**
- [ ] Multi-replica tested in Kubernetes
- [ ] Documentation updated (main architecture docs)
- [ ] Monitoring/alerts configured
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Security Considerations

1. **PostgreSQL LISTEN connection:** Uses same credentials as main application
2. **Event payload:** No sensitive data in events (reference IDs only)
3. **Event table access:** Protected by database authentication
4. **Network isolation:** PostgreSQL never exposed externally (Kubernetes Network Policy)

## Known Limitations & Testing Notes

### WebSocket End-to-End Testing

**Note:** WebSocket connections are tested using FastAPI's WebSocket test client and file-based SQLite for shared database access between test session and EventListener.

**Test Coverage Strategy:**
- ✅ **Unit tests**: Complete coverage of all event system components (EventRepository, EventPublisher, EventListener implementations, EventSystemManager, EventCleanupService, WebSocketConnectionManager, event helpers)
- ✅ **Integration tests**: Real EventListener integration with database, event publishing flow, WebSocket broadcasting
- ✅ **E2E tests**: Alert processing flow fully tested (events published, persisted, and broadcast via WebSocket)

**Manual WebSocket Testing:**
```bash
# Test WebSocket endpoint with websocat or similar tool
websocat ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws

# Send subscription message
{"action":"subscribe","channel":"sessions"}

# Test catchup mechanism
{"action":"catchup","channel":"sessions","last_event_id":42}
```

**Implementation Status:** All components tested and deployed. WebSocket provides reliable bi-directional communication with proper multi-tab support.
