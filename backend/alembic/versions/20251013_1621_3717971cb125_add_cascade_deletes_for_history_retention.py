"""add cascade deletes for history retention

Revision ID: 3717971cb125
Revises: 3d5f7251e766
Create Date: 2025-10-13 16:21:00.000000

Adds ON DELETE CASCADE to all foreign keys referencing alert_sessions and
stage_executions to enable automatic cleanup of related records when old
sessions are deleted based on history_retention_days configuration.
