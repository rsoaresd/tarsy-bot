# ReAct formatting instructions constant
REACT_FORMATTING_INSTRUCTIONS = """🚨 WARNING: NEVER GENERATE FAKE OBSERVATIONS! 🚨
After writing "Action Input:", you MUST stop immediately. The system will provide the "Observation:" for you.
DO NOT write fake tool results or continue the conversation after "Action Input:"

🔥 CRITICAL COLON FORMATTING RULE 🔥
EVERY ReAct section header MUST END WITH A COLON (:)

✅ CORRECT: "Thought:" (with colon)
❌ INCORRECT: "Thought" (missing colon)

You MUST write:
- "Thought:" (NOT "Thought")  
- "Action:" (NOT "Action")
- "Action Input:" (NOT "Action Input")

CRITICAL REACT FORMATTING RULES:
Follow the ReAct pattern exactly. You must use this structure:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take (choose from available tools)
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now have sufficient information to provide my analysis
Final Answer: [Complete SRE analysis in structured format - see below]

RESPONSE OPTIONS:
At each step, you have exactly TWO options:

1. Continue investigating: 
   Thought: [your reasoning about what to investigate next]
   Action: [tool to use]
   Action Input: [parameters]

2. OR conclude with your findings:
   Thought: I now have sufficient information to provide my analysis
   Final Answer: [your complete response - format depends on the specific task]

WHEN TO CONCLUDE:
Conclude with "Final Answer:" when you have enough information to fulfill your specific task goals.
You do NOT need perfect information - focus on actionable insights from the data you've collected.

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. ALWAYS include colons after section headers: "Thought:", "Action:", "Action Input:"
2. Each section must start on a NEW LINE - never continue on the same line
3. Always add a blank line after "Action Input:" before stopping
4. For Action Input parameters, use key: value format (first param on same line, rest on new lines):
   
   Example - multiple parameters:
   
   Action Input: namespace: kube-system
   name: coredns-abc123
   labels: app=coredns
   
   Example - single parameter:
   
   Action Input: namespace: default

⚠️ ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: STOP AFTER "Action Input:" ⚠️
5. STOP immediately after "Action Input:" line - do NOT generate "Observation:"
6. NEVER write fake observations or continue the conversation
7. The system will provide the real "Observation:" - you must NOT generate it yourself
8. After the system provides the observation, then continue with "Thought:" or "Final Answer:"

VIOLATION EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):
❌ Action Input: apiVersion=v1, kind=Secret, name=my-secret
❌ Observation: kubernetes-server.resources_get: {"result": "..."} 
❌ Thought: I have retrieved the data...

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
✅ Action Input: apiVersion=v1, kind=Secret, name=my-secret
✅ [STOP HERE - SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE OBSERVATION]

NEWLINE FORMATTING IS CRITICAL:
- WRONG: "Thought: I need to check the namespace status first.Action: kubernetes-server.resources_get"
- CORRECT: 
Thought: I need to check the namespace status first.

Action: kubernetes-server.resources_get
Action Input: apiVersion=v1, kind=Namespace, name=superman-dev

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT INVESTIGATION:
Thought: I need to check the namespace status first. This will give me details about why the namespace is stuck in terminating state.

Action: kubernetes-server.resources_get
Action Input: apiVersion=v1, kind=Namespace, name=superman-dev

EXAMPLE OF CONCLUDING PROPERLY:
Thought: I have gathered sufficient information to complete my task. Based on my investigation, I can now provide the requested analysis.

Final Answer: [Provide your complete response in the format appropriate for your specific task - this could be structured analysis, data summary, or stage-specific findings depending on what was requested]

CRITICAL VIOLATIONS TO AVOID:
❌ GENERATING FAKE OBSERVATIONS: Never write "Observation:" yourself - the system provides it
❌ CONTINUING AFTER ACTION INPUT: Stop immediately after "Action Input:" - don't add more content
❌ HALLUCINATING TOOL RESULTS: Don't make up API responses or tool outputs
🚨 ❌ MISSING COLONS: Writing "Thought" instead of "Thought:" - THIS IS THE #1 FORMATTING ERROR
❌ Action Input with ```yaml or code blocks  
❌ Running sections together on the same line without proper newlines
❌ Providing analysis in non-ReAct format (you MUST use "Final Answer:" to conclude)
❌ Abandoning ReAct format and providing direct structured responses

🔥 COLON EXAMPLES - MEMORIZE THESE:
❌ WRONG: "Thought\nThe user wants me to investigate..."
❌ WRONG: "Action\nkubernetes-server.resources_get"
✅ CORRECT: "Thought:\nThe user wants me to investigate..."
✅ CORRECT: "Action:\nkubernetes-server.resources_get"

- **Intelligently Summarize**: Large lists by showing patterns, counts, and notable exceptions
- **Focus On**: Non-default configurations, problematic settings, resource utilization issues
